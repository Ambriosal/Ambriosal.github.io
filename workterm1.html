                                    This office is a key research hub, partnering with various colleges, the Ontario

                                    It serves as a central point for scientists, researchers, students, and
                                    organizations seeking research processing and approval.

                                    In the IT department, we handled all things tech—from maintaining database records
                                    and automating processes to managing the office’s website.

                                    My title was <strong>Information Technology Assistant</strong>. A major
                                    responsibility in this role was <i>web content management</i>.
                                    When requested by coworkers, I made necessary modifications to the office's website
                                    using Drupal, HTML, CSS, and other web development technologies.
                                    I was also responsible for ensuring that all published online content complied with
                                    AODA and WCAG requirements.
                                    In addition to web content management, I provided technical support for staff,
                                    including assistance with hybrid meetings, PDF form creation, and the use of
                                    Microsoft Office products.
                                    Another key duty was maintaining the operational integrity of internal email records
                                    stored in the office's database.

                        <p> Since this position is hybrid (both remote and physical), I need to
                            be able to effectively balance my working hours and personal
                            time. I want to meet deadlines and complete tasks in a timely
                            manner. I want to be organized and aware of the tasks that need

                    <div>
                        <h5> Work</h5>
                        <p>During my co-op position, I embraced a hybrid work model, spending two days a week in the
                            office and the rest working remotely. My primary role involved managing web update requests
                            from various divisions within the office. Given my background in web development
                            technologies like HTML and CSS, I adapted quickly to using Drupal, the content management
                            system we relied on. My tasks included ensuring all content met AODA requirements, which
                            added an extra layer of detail and care to my work.</p>

                        <p>One of the most significant projects I was involved in was transforming a cumbersome 75-page
                            manual process into a sleek, online form for the Human Ethics department. This was a
                            cross-departmental effort involving over a dozen team members from different offices. My
                            role was to integrate all the web content about the new system, which required meticulous
                            attention to detail and collaboration.</p>

                        <p>Another critical responsibility was managing the office's email records database, which
                            contained over 4,000 records spanning a decade. I was tasked with ensuring the records were
                            processed correctly and creating reports on defective records to identify and resolve
                            issues. Additionally, I played a key role in migrating our content management system from
                            Drupal to Backdrop. This transition involved creating suitable alternatives for missing
                            components in Backdrop and ensuring configurations were consistent between the old and new
                            systems.</p>

                        <h5>People</h5>
                        <p>The people I worked with made my experience truly memorable. Despite the office often being
                            quiet due to many employees working from home, I was able to forge meaningful connections
                            with my colleagues. My supervisor, Tom Crabtree, and my mentor, Andrew Burke, were
                            incredibly supportive and knowledgeable. The IT department, a tight-knit team of three,
                            provided invaluable guidance and camaraderie. Their support was instrumental in my
                            professional growth over the eight months.</p>

                        <h5> Contributions</h5>
                        <p>My contributions ranged from day-to-day tasks like managing web content and ensuring AODA
                            compliance to significant projects such as the internal form automation and content
                            migration. Each task, whether it involved technical challenges or collaborative efforts,
                            allowed me to apply and expand my skills. The experience of working on diverse projects,
                            from web content management to complex database maintenance, was both challenging and
                            rewarding.</p>
                        <h5> Fun</h5>
                        <p>Beyond the work, the office culture added a delightful dimension to my co-op experience. I
                            eagerly participated in various social events, including ice-cream socials, agriculture lab
                            tours, and project launch parties. These events provided a refreshing break from work and
                            helped me connect with my colleagues on a more personal level.</p>
                        <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                        <p>Overall, my time as a co-op student was an incredible journey filled with learning, growth,
                            and connection. The supportive team, diverse projects, and engaging office events made it a
                            truly enriching experience.</p>

                    <p>It was an amazing experience and I gained so much on different levels.
                        I learned how the office's worflow and business process which strengthened my time managment,
                        problem solving and communication.
                        This role was related to my future career path and gained tech-business insight. My skills in
                        web development and program problem solving evolved too.
                        This job was relatively indepdnent - I'm assigned a task and expected to complete them in
                        reasonable time. The manner of which I complete the task is completelty up to me,
                        which gave me some creative freedom and a sense of greater responsibility.</p>

                    <h5>Time Management</h5>
                    <p> Due to the increase of responsibilities in comparison to my Work
                        Study position, I achieved great work-life balance. I kept track of
                        my work responsibilities and completing them in the allotted
                        time.</p>
                    <h5>Problem Solving</h5>
                    <p> I was highly independent when assigned tasks, completing them on my own while knowing when to
                        seek help if needed.
                        Additionally, I kept my coworkers and supervisors informed with regular updates on my progress.
                    </p>
                    <h5> Communication</h5>
                    <p>Throughout my time here, I maintained effective communication in all aspects of my role.
                        Whether during weekly meetings, handling requests, or providing project updates,
                        I consistently communicated clearly and efficiently with my teammates. </p>
